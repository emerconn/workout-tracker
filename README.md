# workout-tracker

A workout tracking app! Wow!

This is my first full-stack app, in an effort to learn more about web dev, containers, & GitOps.

The initial primary objective is a web SPA to keep track of workouts composed of exercises.

## tech stack

- backend: Go
- frontend
  - React using Typescript
  - Vite builder
  - MUI library
  - _why is frontend so miserable_
- database: MongoDB (Atlas)
- ci: GitHub Actions
- host: TBD
